      "### What is a Quadratic Equation?\n",
      "A **quadratic equation** is a type of polynomial equation of degree 2. Its general form is:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n",
      "\\]\n",

      "- \\( x \\) is the variable,\n",
      "- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants (with \\( a \\neq 0 \\)).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why is it called a quadratic equation?\n",
      "Because the highest power of the variable \\( x \\) is 2 (from the term \\( x^2 \\)), and \"quad\" means square.\n",

      "### How to solve a quadratic equation?\n",
      "\n",
