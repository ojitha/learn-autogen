      "Great set of ideas! Here’s a brief evaluation to help prioritize and refine:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **\"The Green Home Makeover Challenge\"**  \n",
      "   - Strengths: Engaging, real-life transformation makes it relatable; good for social media and influencer partnerships.  \n",
      "   - Considerations: Requires participants and more production resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **\"Eco-Heroes: The Clean Squad\"**  \n",
      "   - Strengths: Unique, fun, and memorable; excellent for younger audiences and educational content.  \n",

      "   - Strengths: Aspirational and visionary; great for brand positioning in the long term.  \n",
      "   - Considerations: More abstract; might be less immediate in driving purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:  \n",
      "- Decide if the campaign is focused on education, emotional connection, or call-to-action-driven engagement.  \n",
      "- Based on that, I can help you develop detailed scripts or suggest media mix strategies.  \n",
